        title: CHECKING AND SUPPLEMENTATION OF DATA
        text: |
            We ask you to check the names of repressed persons known to you and if necessary, give us feedback concerning corrections and additions. Suggestions are also welcome in cases where the same person is likely referred to under two different names and the suspicion arises that different persons should be combined into one.

            We are very grateful for corrections and additions. They have already been of great assistance in drawing up the list of persons who have perished. We enter accepted corrections on a running basis, thus the list is continuously being updated and changed.
