            Estonia lost every fifth person of its population of slightly over a million as a consequence of the terror imposed by the occupying regime.

            A total of over 75,000 people from Estonia were murdered, imprisoned or deported. The Memorial to the victims of communism is dedicated to all of them!

            The people and nation of Estonia established the Memorial in 2018 in memory of Estonia’s victims of communism.
