            The Home Garden is a place where dreams, memories and the yearning for home are intertwined. Apple trees and honeybees are the symbols of the Home Garden.

            The list of victims on the Memorialâ€™s Journey is not final because thousands of sufferers did not make it back home and their fate is unknown to this day. Research for identifying and ascertaining these victims continues. Their names will also be inscribed here on this wall. Until then, these apple trees and the location stones denoting the sites of terror remind us of them.
