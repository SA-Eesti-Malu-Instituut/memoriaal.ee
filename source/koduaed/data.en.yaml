            The Home Garden is a place where dreams, memories and a yearning for home are intertwined. The apple trees planted here, between which footpaths meander, are the symbols of the Home Garden, and a swarm of honeybees that sticks together in spite of everything is depicted on the wall (motif from the poem Ta lendab mesipuu poole [He Flies towards the Beehive] by Juhan Liiv, which Miina HÃ¤rma and Peep Sarapik have put to music, is sung at the national song festivals as a song of mourning, resistance and hope). The figures of 22,000 honeybees symbolise the victims who have perished (each figure is a model of a honeybee that once lived). The ceremonial square is meant for holding memorial events.
