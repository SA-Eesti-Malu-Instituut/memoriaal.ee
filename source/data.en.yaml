            Estonia lost one of every five persons from its population of slightly over one million as a consequence of the occupying regime’s terror policy.

            Today the vast majority of them rest in unnamed graves without crosses. May this memorial be the site for commemorating them!

            The Estonian people and the Estonian state have established this memorial in 2018 in memory of Estonia’s victims of communism.
